//"Count and Say problem" Write a code to do following:
//        n String to print
//        0 1
//        1 1 1
//        2 2 1
//        3 1 2 1 1
//        ...
//        Base case: n = 0 print "1"
//        for n = 1, look at previous string and write number of times
//        a digit is seen and the digit itself. In this case, digit 1 is
//        seen 1 time in a row... so print "1 1"
//        for n = 2, digit 1 is seen two times in a row, so print "2 1"
//        for n = 3, digit 2 is seen 1 time and then digit 1 is
//        seen 1 so print "1 2 1 1"
//        for n = 4 you will print "1 1 1 2 2 1"
//
//        Consider the numbers as integers for simplicity.
//        e.g. if previous string is "10 1" then the next
//        will be "1 10 1 1" and the next one will be "1 1 1 10 2 1"
